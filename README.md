# Overview
This project aims to develop effective YARA rules to detect various types of malware based on unique patterns and signatures. The rules are designed to enhance malware detection in cybersecurity systems.

# Problem Statement
Create and refine YARA rules that efficiently identify malware in files and processes.

## Phases of the Project

### Zero (0) Review Phase:
- Research on YARA rule syntax and malware behavior.
- Investigating existing YARA rules and understanding malware patterns.

### 1st Review Phase:
- Development of basic YARA rules.
- Initial testing of these rules on known malware samples.

### 2nd Review Phase:
- Refinement of YARA rules.
- Extensive testing on various malware samples to ensure effectiveness.

### 3rd Review Phase:
- Optimization of YARA rules for performance and accuracy.
- Final testing to ensure low false positives and comprehensive malware detection.
